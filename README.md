### Narayanan Raghupathy's Website

I am, Narayanan Raghupathy, an Assistant Computational Scientist at the Jackson Laboratory.

Earlier, I did my PhD in Computational Biology with Prof. Dannie Durand at Carnegie Mellon University and worked with Prof. John Storey at Princeton University as a postdoc. Then I worked with Gary Churchill's group at the Jackson Laboratory, developing computational/statistical (really cool) methods for analyzing RNA-seq data (with really awesome people).

P.S. Thanks to Karl Broman's tutorial, Jekyll and Poole for the website.
