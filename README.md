### Narayanan Raghupathy's Website

I am, Narayanan Raghupathy, a postdoc with Gary Churchill's group at the Jackson Laboratory. I am working on developing computational/statistical (really cool) methods for analyzing RNA-seq data (with really awesome people).

Earlier, I did my PhD in Computational Biology with Prof. Dannie Durand at Carnegie Mellon University and worked with Prof. John Storey at Princeton University as a postdoc.
