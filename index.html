<p>I am, Narayanan Raghupathy, a Computational Scientist working with <a href="https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/research-scientists/laura-reinholdt">Laura Reinholdt</a>'s group and <a href="https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/tools/genetic-resource-science"> Genetic Resource Science</a>. Earlier, I was a postdoc with <a href="http://churchill.jax.org">Gary Churchill</a>'s group at the <a href="http://www.jax.org">Jackson Laboratory</a>. 

<p> I am interested in working on developing computational/statistical (really cool) <a href="http://narayananr.github.io/research/">methods</a> for analyzing highthroughput sequence data , primarily RNA-seq, exome, WGS data.
 (with <a href="http://churchill.jax.org/"> really</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kwangbom">awesome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemunger">people</a>).</p>

<p>A while ago, I did my PhD in Computational Biology with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~durand">Prof. Dannie Durand </a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu"> Carnegie Mellon University</a> and worked with <a href="http://www.genomine.org/"> Prof. John Storey</a> at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> as a postdoc.</p>

<p> In my earlier life I studied Physics.
