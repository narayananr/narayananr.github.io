I am, Narayanan Raghupathy, a postdoc at the <a href="http://www.jax.org">Jackson Laboratory</a> with <a href="http://churchill.jax.org">Gary Churchill</a>'s group. I am working on developing computational/statistical (really cool) <a href="http://emase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">methods</a> for analyzing RNA-seq data (with really awesome people).

Earlier, I did my PhD in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~durand">Prof. Dannie Durand </a> and worked with <a href="http://www.genomine.org/"> Prof. John Storey</a> at Princeton University as a postdoc.
