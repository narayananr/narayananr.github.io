### Seqnature: Embracing genetic diversity

The central theme of my recent research has been around developing computational method for analyzing RNA-seq data and use the method extensively. More specifically, I started off working on understanding the extent and cause of allele-specific expression using RNA-seq and ended up developing EMASE:Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Allele-specific expression for quantifying expression abundance at both gene and allele levels.
