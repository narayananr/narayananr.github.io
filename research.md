##### Coming soon
The central theme of my recent research has been around developing computational methods for analyzing RNA-seq data and use the method extensively.    
* Accurately quantifing allele specific expression
* EMASE: Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Allele-specific expression

* Characterizing the extent and the cause of allele-specific expression in reciprocal F1 cross using RNA-seq
* expression QTL analysis
