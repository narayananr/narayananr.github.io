The central theme of my recent research has been around developing computational method for analyzing RNA-seq data and use the method extensively. 

Large number of sequencing efforts have characterized genetic variations in detail and catalogued millions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions. However, we are still lagging behind in using the SNPs and indels in a standard sequencing analyses. To address this challenge, We developed Seqnature, software tool that can take known genetic variation and construct individualzied or personalized genome. In case of model organisms, Seqnature can used to construct strain-specific genomes utilizing strain specific variations. In the case of humans, Seqnature can build diploid genomes using phased genetic variations.
 
### Seqnature: Embracing genetic diversity

More specifically, I started off working on understanding the extent and cause of allele-specific expression using RNA-seq and ended up developing EMASE:Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Allele-specific expression for quantifying expression abundance at both gene and allele levels.
