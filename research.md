The central theme of my recent research has been around developing computational/statistical methods for analyzing RNA-seq data and use the method extensively. 

### <font color="DarkCyan">Seqnature: Embracing genetic diversity </font>
Large number of sequencing efforts have characterized genetic variations in detail and catalogued millions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions. However, we are still lagging behind in using the SNPs and indels in a standard sequencing analyses, like RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis pipelines.

To address this challenge, We developed Seqnature, software tool that can take known genetic variation and construct individualzied or personalized genome. In case of model organisms, Seqnature can used to construct strain-specific genomes utilizing strain specific variations. In the case of humans, Seqnature can build diploid genomes using phased genetic variations.

Diploid organisms like humans have two copies (or alleles) of every autosomal gene. When there is one or more genetic variation between the two alleles, we can identify which allele is expressed and how much it is expressed. RNA-seq technology allows us to measure the allele-level expression.
